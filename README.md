# nanoq

Itsy bitsy teeny weeny priority queue implemented as a binary heap.

Supports arbitrary data or, by passing a maximum tree size, will intelligently select a typed array for compact memory usage and performance via indices (...won't somebody think of the mobiles T_T)

Extracted and tuned from a progressive level-of-detail geometry simplification project I'm working on.
